A live demo can be found [here](https://harrylarimerjr.github.io/rock_paper_scissors_js/).

This simple webpage plays rock paper scissors with the user using    
buttons and JavaScript functionality. It uses a random number
generator function to generate a number between 1 and 3. This number
is used to select rock, paper, or scissors. The user clicks the
button of their choice, and the webpage displays the winner. Each
game is five rounds long. The user can also play multiple games by
selecting the reset button at the bottom of the page. This project
demonstrates knowledge of manipulating the DOM with JavaScript -
JavaScript is used to add and remove event listeners from buttons,
add and remove styles in the CSS, create nodes, and append child
nodes to parent nodes.
