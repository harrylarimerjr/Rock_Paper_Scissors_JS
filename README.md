This simple webpage plays rock paper scissors with the user in the
console browser. It uses a random number generator function to generate
a number between 1 and 3. This number is used to select rock, paper, or
scissors. The user enters their choice, and the console is used to
declare a winner. Each game is five rounds long. The user can also play
multiple games - the JavaScript will track won and lost games. A report
is displayed at the end for the user to see how many games they won and
how many they lost. This program also demonstrates skills in writing a
simple input validation function. If the user enters text into the
prompt, the string is converted to lowercase letters using the
toLowerCase string method. After this, the input is validated against
acceptable answers. If the function returns false, the user must enter
something else. This continues until the user enters a valid answer.
